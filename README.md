# 5" Electric  Model Railway

Lovers of model railways have a wide collection of scales. One of the rarest are the 5-inch gauge. These machines are capable of taking several wagons full of visitors through an outdoor park. There are many different types, with steam being the most striking and representative.

I like to build things, and in this repository I leave useful material on the construction of my first machine, a very simple electrical model. I have done this project with my father, who is the person who has passed on my love for trains.
